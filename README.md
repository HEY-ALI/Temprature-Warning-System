#Temperature Warning System Project

  This project is a simulation of a temperature warning system using an Arduino Uno and an NTC thermistor. 
  The system uses three LEDs to indicate different temperature ranges: green for temperatures below 30째C, 
  yellow for temperatures between 30째C and 80째C (inclusive), and red for temperatures above 80째C.

  

#Features

  Monitors temperature using an NTC thermistor connected to the Arduino Uno.
  Three LEDs (red, yellow, green) provide visual temperature indicators.
  Simple C++ code in the .ino file controls LED behavior based on temperature readings.



#Getting Started

  Prerequisites
   Arduino IDE (for uploading code to the Arduino Uno)

  Installation
  1. Clone or download the project repository.
     git clone https://github.com/HEY-ALI/Temperature-Warning-System.git

  2. Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.

  3. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno board.


     

#Usage

  1. Set up the hardware components as described in the project documentation or simulation.

  2. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.

  3. Power on the system and observe the LED colors changing based on the temperature reading.
